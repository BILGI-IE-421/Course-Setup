# How to Publish Your GitHub Classroom Repository as a GitHub Pages Site

Follow these steps to publish your assignment repository as a GitHub Pages website.

## Step 1: Navigate to Your Repository

- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account.
- Navigate to your assignment repository on GitHub Classroom.

## Step 2: Access Repository Settings

- On your repository page, click on the **Settings** tab.
  - *Note:* If you don't see the **Settings** tab, it might be under the dropdown menu labeled **â˜°** or **...** next to the other tabs (like **Code**, **Issues**, **Pull requests**).

## Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages

- In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
  - *Note:* If you don't see **Pages** in the sidebar, look under the **Code and automation** section.
- Under **Build and deployment**, find the **Source** section.

## Step 4: Select the Source Branch and Folder

- **Branch**: Select `main` (or the default branch of your repository) from the dropdown menu.
- **Folder**: Choose one of the following based on where your site files are located:
  - `/ (root)` if your site files (like `index.html`) are in the root directory of your repository.
  - `/docs` if your site files are in a `docs` folder.
- Click **Save**.

## Step 5: Wait for Your Site to Publish

- After saving, GitHub will start building your site. This process may take a few minutes.
- Once the site is published, you'll see a green success message with the URL of your site at the top of the **Pages** settings page.


## Step 6: Visit and Share Your Site

- Click on the provided URL to visit your published site.
- Share this URL as instructed.
